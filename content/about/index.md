I'm **Jonathan Lin**, an aspiring Cloud Architect from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. As of 2020, I have close to **8 years of professional software development experience**, though not always as an employee. Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonlinernsheong/) to connect with me professionally (drop me a note that you found me via my blog!)

This is my technical cloud blog. In this blog, I will explore cloud concepts, ideas, and topics that interest me. I am unapologetically keen and enthusiastic about Google Cloud, but also because that is what I am most hands-on with these days. Google Cloud is the first cloud that "clicked" for me. Nonetheless, I will try to remain as objective and fair as possible in my blog posts, and also cover other cloud providers as I journey around ;)

You can find my personal blog [here](https://jonlin.es). Check out my [books on cloud topics](/books/)!
